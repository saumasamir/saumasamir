## What We Do

We're not another software house. We're performance specialists who fix systems that break under load.

### Our Focus
- **Sub-100ms response times** globally
- **10x throughput improvements** without infrastructure changes  
- **70%+ cloud cost reduction** through optimization
- **Zero-downtime migrations** to scalable architectures

### What We DON'T Do
- ❌ MVPs or prototypes
- ❌ Simple CRUD applications
- ❌ WordPress or basic websites
- ❌ "Just make it work" projects

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Database Layer
- **Query optimization** - From N+1 to single query
- **Connection pooling** - PgBouncer, ProxySQL
- **Sharding strategies** - Horizontal scaling to infinity
- **Read replicas** - Distribute read load

#### Application Layer
- **Caching strategies** - Multi-layer intelligent caching
- **Async processing** - Event-driven architectures
- **Memory optimization** - Zero-allocation hot paths
- **Concurrency patterns** - Lock-free data structures

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Auto-scaling** - Predictive, not reactive
- **CDN optimization** - Edge computing strategies
- **Service mesh** - Istio, Linkerd for reliability
- **Load balancing** - Geographic and latency-based

## 📈 Case Studies

### Case Study #1: Black Friday Survivor
**Challenge:** E-commerce platform crashing during sales

**Our Solution:**
```python
# Before: Synchronous, blocking operations
def process_order(order):
    validate_inventory()  # 200ms
    charge_payment()      # 500ms
    send_email()         # 300ms
    update_analytics()   # 100ms
    return success       # Total: 1100ms

# After: Async, event-driven
async def process_order(order):
    await validate_inventory()  # 20ms
    publish_event("order_created", order)
    return success  # Total: 25ms
    # Payment, email, analytics processed async
```

**Result:** From 500 orders/sec to 45,000 orders/sec

### Case Study #2: The Streaming Platform
**Challenge:** Video platform buffering with 10k concurrent viewers

**Our Solution:**
- Implemented adaptive bitrate streaming
- Added GeoDNS with regional caches
- Optimized video encoding pipeline
- Introduced predictive pre-loading

**Result:** 500k concurrent viewers, zero buffering

   - 100ms is slow for us
   - Every query is optimized
   - Every byte counts

3. **We Plan for 100x**
   - Today's architecture handles tomorrow's load
   - Linear scaling, not exponential costs
   - No surprises at scale

4. **We Deliver ROI**
   - Our optimizations pay for themselves
   - Usually within 30-60 days
   - Documented cost savings

## 🚀 Our Philosophy

```go
// Most companies write code like this:
func makeItWork() {
    // Just ship it
}

// We write code like this:
func makeItScale() {
    // Measure everything
    // Optimize ruthlessly  
    // Plan for millions
    // Never let it break
}
```

**Performance isn't a feature. It's THE feature.**
